**AquaGuard Web** is a full-stack emergency flood management platform — the web companion to the [AquaGuard iOS App](https://github.com/shynnguyen1004/AquaGuard-iOS). It provides real-time flood mapping, community-driven rescue coordination, and AI-assisted emergency support across three dedicated role-based interfaces: Admin, Rescuer, and Citizen.

> **Status:** 🚀 Active Development — EPICS 8th Competition Build

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎭 Role-Based Dashboards (RBAC)
A full **Role-Based Access Control** system powers three distinct user experiences:

- **🛡️ Admin Dashboard:** Full-system overview with a live **Flood Map Editor**, user management panel, rescue team tracker, stats overview, and real-time SOS request monitoring. Admins can create, edit, and delete flood zones directly on the map.
- **⛑️ Rescuer Dashboard:** Mission-focused interface with an active rescue requests feed, mission acceptance workflow (`Pending → Assigned → In Progress → Resolved`), and personal mission history. Real-time updates via auto-refresh every 10 seconds.
- **🏘️ Citizen Dashboard:** Full-featured emergency management interface — detailed below in [Citizen Features](#-citizen-features).

### 🏘️ Citizen Features

#### 🏠 Dashboard (Home)
- **Personalization:** Displays the user's name and personal safety status (Safe / In Danger / Injured).
- **Active SOS Banner:** A prominent banner showing your active SOS request (if any), with real-time status (Pending → Assigned → In Progress), the name of the rescuer who accepted it, and the submission time. Tap it to jump straight to the SOS page.
- **Family Safety Board:** Shows your connected family members, their safety status (Safe ✅ / In Danger 🔴 / Injured 🟠), health notes, and last update time. Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.
- **Pending Family Invites:** Family connection invite notifications — accept or decline with a single tap.

- **🗺️ Rescue Tracking Map:** When a request is being handled (`in_progress`), the citizen can open a full-screen map to:
  - See their own location (red marker) and the rescuer's location (green marker) on a real-time map.
  - See the route from the rescuer to the citizen via the OSRM API.
  - See the distance (km) and estimated time.
  - Connect over a real-time WebSocket (Firebase Realtime DB) — location updates continuously.

- **4G SOS SMS:** Register emergency data packages from Viettel, Vinaphone, and Mobifone — works when there's no internet.

#### 📰 News & Alerts
- **Flood News Feed:** Aggregated flood news with images, sources, category labels (Danger / Warning / Info), and content summaries.
- **Report Issue Form:** An issue report form (Bug / Feature / Data / Other) with file attachments and drag-and-drop.

#### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Family Safety
- **Find family members:** Search by phone number and send a connection invite with a relationship (Father, Mother, ...).
- **Manage connections:** Accept/decline invites, remove connections.
- **Safety status:** Update your personal status (Safe / In Danger / Injured / Unknown) + health notes.
- **Family monitoring:** View each member's safety status, health notes, address, and last update time.

#### 🤖 AI ChatBot

    - 🔴 **Red:** Severe (High Risk)
    - 🟡 **Amber:** Moderate (Caution)
    - 🟢 **Green:** Safe (Low Risk)
- **Precipitation Radar Overlay:** Live rain radar powered by the free **RainViewer API**, refreshing every 5 minutes.
- **Weather Layers:** Optional wind, temperature, cloud, and pressure overlays via OpenWeatherMap.
- **Sovereign Map Tiles:** Uses **VNDMS Vietnam government tiles** — officially includes Hoàng Sa and Trường Sa island coverage.
- **Admin Map Editor:** Admins can add, edit, and remove flood zone markers directly on the map in real time.
- **Map Legend:** Built-in severity legend and map controls for quick reference.

### 🆘 Emergency Action Center

- **Report Issue Form:** Citizens can submit bug reports, feature requests, and data issues with file attachments.

### 🔐 Authentication & Sessions
- **Phone + Password Auth:** Primary login is Vietnamese phone number (`+84...`) + password, hashed with bcrypt and issued a role-encoded **JWT** (7-day expiry) by the backend.
- **Optional Google Sign-In:** Firebase Google sign-in is available as a secondary option.
- **Role at Registration:** Users pick their role (Citizen, Rescuer, or Admin) during sign-up; Admin/Rescuer roles require a shared role password.
- **OTP Password Reset:** "Forgot password" sends an SMS OTP via **Twilio Verify**, then issues a short-lived reset session.
- **Transactional Email:** Welcome email on registration and family-invite/accept notifications are sent via **Resend** (fire-and-forget, never blocks the request).
- **Persistent Sessions:** JWT + user are stored client-side and restored on reload; falls back to Firebase user data if the backend is unreachable.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🐳 Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The fastest way to run the project — you only need **Docker Desktop** installed.

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/shynnguyen1004/AquaGuard-WebApp.git
cd AquaGuard-WebApp

# 2. Copy env templates
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env

# 3. Fill in API keys in backend/.env and frontend/.env (ask your team lead)

# 4. Start the whole stack (the compose file lives in infrastructure/)
docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Once it's up and running:
- 🌐 **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- 🔌 **Backend API:** http://localhost:5001/api/health
- 🐘 **PostgreSQL:** localhost:5433 (user: `aquaguard`, pass: `aquaguard_pass`, db: `aquaguard_db`)

> 📌 The database is automatically initialized with the schema and seed data from `infrastructure/database/init_db.sql`.

Useful Docker commands (or use `make -f infrastructure/Makefile <target>`):
```bash
DC="docker compose -f infrastructure/docker-compose.yml"

$DC down                       # Stop all services (keeps data)
$DC logs -f backend            # View backend logs
$DC down -v && $DC up --build  # Reset database (wipes data, re-runs init_db.sql)
$DC up postgres backend        # Run only backend + database

# Add an npm package to the backend → must rebuild & renew the anonymous node_modules volume:
$DC up -d --build --renew-anon-volumes backend
```

> ⚠️ The backend runs `node --watch`, so editing `.js` files auto-reloads. But changing `backend/.env` requires `up -d` to recreate the container (a plain `restart` does not reload env).

---

### 🖥️ Manual Setup (Without Docker)

#### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** >= 20.x, **npm** >= 10.x
- A **PostgreSQL** instance (local, Docker, or a cloud provider like Neon)

#### 1. Backend (`/backend`)

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in real values
npm run dev                   # node --watch index.js → http://localhost:5001
```

Create the schema by loading `infrastructure/database/init_db.sql` into your database
(e.g. `psql "$DATABASE_URL" -f infrastructure/database/init_db.sql`).
There is no migration runner — the files in `backend/migrations/` are SQL applied manually.

#### 2. Frontend (`/frontend`)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env          # then fill in real values
npm run dev                   # vite → http://localhost:5173
npm run build                 # production build
```

## 🗺️ Deployment

| Part | Hosted on | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Frontend** | **Vercel** — `aquaguard.vn` (+ `www`) and the `*.vercel.app` subdomain | Auto-deploys on push to `main`. |
| **Backend API + WebSocket** | **Render** (`aquaguard-api.onrender.com`) | Free tier sleeps after ~15 min idle; an UptimeRobot monitor pings `/api/health` to keep it warm. |
| **PostgreSQL** | **Neon** (serverless Postgres) | Connected via `DATABASE_URL`; SSL auto-enabled. |
| **Email** | **Resend** | Sends from the DNS-verified domain `aquaguard.vn`. |

Production secrets are configured as environment variables on each platform (Render / Vercel), not committed to the repo.
